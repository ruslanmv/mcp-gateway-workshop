# Appendix G — Kindle Production Tips

- Use fenced code blocks with language hints (`bash`, `python`, `yaml`)
- Prefer short, single-column tables; avoid wide layouts
- Keep screenshots ≤ **1200 px** wide and name consistently (`NN_topic.png`)
- Split large chapters with H2/H3 for navigation
- Include the ToC as front matter; KDP will auto-detect section headings
